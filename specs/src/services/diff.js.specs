# Module Spec: diff.js

## 1. Description
This module provides a function to generate and display a compact and elegant diff between two strings. This is used to show the user the proposed changes before they are applied.

## 2. Exported Functions
- `diff(oldString: string, newString: string): string` â€“ Produces a unified-style diff that highlights deletions and additions while preserving unchanged context, returning a string ready for console output.

## 3. Dependencies
- None. It can be implemented using a simple line-by-line comparison or by integrating a lightweight diffing library.

## 4. Implementation Details
- Use ANSI colour codes (or equivalent) so removals appear in red with a leading `-` and additions appear in green with `+`.
- Include a small amount of unchanged context to help the reader orient themselves without overwhelming them with full-file content.
- Normalise line endings before diffing to avoid noisy output across platforms.

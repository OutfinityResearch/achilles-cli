# Title
Task Parsing And Agent Routing

## Description
Each planner agent receives section-specific text and must emit structured tasks whose `target` begins with the specification file they affect. Tasks can represent info, create, update, delete, or suggestion operations. Suggestions must encode status metadata and, when `accepted`, include a follow-up instruction that identifies the owning agent by inspecting the file extension. The shared task factory must ensure every task has a unique id and captures the original text for auditing.

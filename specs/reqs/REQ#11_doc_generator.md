# Requirement: HTML Documentation Generator

## 1. User Story
As a developer, I want to generate a single HTML file that contains all the project specifications (vision, requirements, and module specs), so that I can have a consolidated, easy-to-read, and shareable documentation of my project.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- A new agent, `achilles-doc-generator.js`, will be created.
- This agent will be executed via a bash script `achilles-htmldoc`.
- The agent will read all the files from `specs/` directory.
- It will use an LLM to process the content of each file to make it more readable and to add cross-references.
- The agent will generate a single HTML file, `specs.html`, in the root of the project.
- The HTML file must have a table of contents to allow for easy navigation.
- If the LLM call fails or returns an invalid payload, the agent must log a descriptive (single-line) error message and avoid generating or overwriting `specs.html`.

## 3. Impacted Modules
- `src/achilles-doc-generator.js`: The new agent for documentation generation.
- `bin/achilles-htmldoc`: The bash script to run the agent.
- `src/services/LLMAgentClient.js`: To interact with the LLM.
- `src/services/specsManager.js`: To read the specification files.

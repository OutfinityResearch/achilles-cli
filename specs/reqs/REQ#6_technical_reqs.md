# Requirement: Technical and Architectural Requirements

## 1. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Platform:** The entire application must be built on Node.js.
- **Dependencies:** The generated code should be dependency-free vanilla Node.js code. The Achilles-CLI tool itself should aim to have minimal external npm dependencies.
- **File Format:** All vision, requirement, and specification documents must be Markdown files.
- **Code Design Principles:** The code generated by `achilles-codeGenerator` must adhere to established software design principles, particularly SOLID and YAGNI, to ensure the output is maintainable, scalable, and robust. These principles should be embedded into the prompts used for code generation.

## 2. Impacted Modules
- This requirement impacts the entire project, particularly the `achilles-codeGenerator` and the prompts it uses.

# Requirement: Clarification Question Management

## 1. User Story
As a developer, I want the `achilles-planner` to manage clarification questions intelligently, so that I am not overwhelmed with questions but can still provide necessary input.

## 2. Functional Requirements
- The system will maintain an internal list of low-priority clarification questions that arise during planning but are not critical enough to interrupt the user.
- After a set of actions is completed, the agent will review this list, discard any questions that have since been answered, and present a prioritized list of the remaining questions to the user as suggestions for the next steps.
- The agent should only ask urgent questions during the main discussion flow.

## 3. Impacted Modules
- `src/achilles-planner.js`: Will manage the list of clarification questions.

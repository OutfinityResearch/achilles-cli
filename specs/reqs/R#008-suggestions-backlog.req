# Title
Suggestions Backlog Lifecycle

## Description
The planner must persist AI suggestions in `.achilles/.suggestions/suggestions.md`, migrating legacy `.ideas/ideas.md` content on first access. Suggestion entries follow the pattern `- [status] path: detail`, where status is `accepted`, `rejected`, or `ignored`. Rejected ideas are removed from the backlog, accepted ideas trigger immediate execution against the referenced file via the appropriate sub-agent, and ignored entries remain untouched for later review.

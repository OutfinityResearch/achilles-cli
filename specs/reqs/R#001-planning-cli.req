# Title
Planning CLI Interaction

## Description
The planner must expose a readline-based CLI that greets the user with guidance on the required request structure, reports how many suggestions are recorded, and continuously accepts input. Every non-empty turn is parsed into the seven mandated sections (info, vision, Requirements, Memory, Specs, Design Specifications, Ideas). Parsed sections are rendered as a canonical markdown document, summarised for the user, and converted into ordered tasks that announce "Thinking about â€¦" before execution. Typing `stop` exits gracefully, while blank input is ignored.

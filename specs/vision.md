# Title
Planning Platform

## Purpose
Provide a command-line driven suite of collaborating AI agents that capture project knowledge as layered specifications, keep those documents in sync with the source code, and automate follow-up activities such as code generation, documentation, diagnostics, reverse-spec extraction, and continuous planning.

## Technology
Node.js runtime with modular JavaScript services, Markdown-based specifications stored under `specs/`, local filesystem storage for persistent context (`.achilles/`), and LLM integrations selectable via environment-driven configuration (fast & deep models).
